Project Oscar
====================

Motivation
----------

Unlike .NET, which requires that applications are packaged as assemblies
with explicit dependencies among them, the Java platform does not offer
sufficient support for modularity. This lack of support complicates not
only Java application development, but also subsequent deployment and
administration. Many of the complications result from the fact that
every project that requires some form of modularity ends up inventing
their own ClassLoader-based approach for solving their needs. This
phenomenon is evident in application servers, integrated development
environments, and any component- or plugin-oriented systems. The OSGi
framework defined by the OSGi Alliance has a long history of addressing
these types of issues and the imminent release of version R4 of the OSGi
specification is set to move the OSGi framework even further along
this path.

The recent adoption of OSGi technology as the modularity layer of the
Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) underscores the inroads that OSGi
technology has made. Further, the announcement of JSR 277 verifies that
demand for modularity in Java has reached a critical point.

This project can serve the greater Java open source community by
providing immediate modularity support for Java applications today
through the OSGi framework, creating a unifying community around open
source OSGi technology, and tracking and participating in the progression
of JSR 277.


Proposal
--------

We propose the creation of a new Apache project, Oscar, that will achieve
the following goals :

1) create a compliant, independent implementation of the OSGi R4 core
   framework with framework-dependent services under the Apache License,
   Version 2.0.

2) unify resources from the OSGi community to implement, document, maintain,
   and support standard OSGi R4 services.

3) provide a focal point for the OSGi community to develop interfaces, APIs,
   and other common needs not fully specified by the OSGi R4 specification,
   such as store interfaces, aspects of the runtime container's packaging
   and configuration, and the design and behavior of bundle repositories.
   
4) provide a focal point for the open-source OSGi community to develop next
   generation enhancements to the core framework and act as a conduit for
   the open-source community to the OSGi Alliance.
   
5) evangelize the OSGi Service Platform within Apache and provide documentation
   and support for successful container migrations.


Starting Participants
---------------------

We propose that the following people are considered the starting participants.
We hope to start with a diverse cross-section of the community and preserve
this as we grow. The information in parenthesis indicates other community
participation or relevant experiences of that individual.

architecture and design work and in participating as committers for the
Apache-licensed implementation :

   Richard Hall (OSGi Alliance (Invited Researcher) and Founder of the Oscar project)

Operating Considerations
------------------------

We have established a list for discussions. Unless your comment is directed
to the general Incubator community or the Incubator PMC, please post
everything to :

     oscar-dev@incubator.apache.org

You can subscribe by sending an email to

Until this proposal has been accepted by the Apache Incubator PMC, these lists
are provisional.
